# Fun Project

Creating a SPA (Single Page Application) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript showing all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people) where it displays an image for each of the characters. It makes a HTTP request to the star wars API and using the result from the request to populate my frontend application
